{"count": 1, "notes": [{"content": "<p>This blog is \"powered\" by <a href=\"lekhakpadmanabh.github.io\">GitNote</a> - a command line note management utility I wrote up quickly to cater specifically to my requirements. There are a couple of rough edges but it is mostly functional. At this point I cannot recommend anyone to use it, mainly because it is being built and tested on github pages, which forbids angular's routing-- which means no permalinking to individual articles. When I was writing it this wasn't a concern for me, but I will probably write its own cusotm backend one of these days.</p>\n\n<h2>To Do</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create an extension to python-markdown for handling image sizes</li>\n<li>Add logging</li>\n<li>Make the code root directory-independent</li>\n<li>If user changes title, rename the file</li>\n<li>Generate standalone html for permalinking</li>\n<li>Wiki features-- revision history, etc.</li>\n<li>Add ipython notebook support.</li>\n<li>Write Tests</li>\n<li>Add some docs </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n\n<p>Notes can be made inline or in markdown files, which are stored in a notes/ folder. Python then asks git for changes in this folder, parses the file, converts it file to html, puts them in a nice json file which is then used by angular on the frontend.

The above command creates a opens a new file in your default text-editor. Enter your note in markdown, save it, close and run </p>\n\n<pre><code>gitnote build\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If it is your first time it'll ask for some adidtional info, then your note is tracked and committed. Now you just push to whatever is your remote static file server and you're done. In my case, I am using the free github pages.</p>\n\n<pre><code>git push origin master\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>New note inline</h3>\n\n<p>For short notes, </p>\n\n<pre><code>gitnote inline -b \"hello world\" -t \"this is the title\" -g \"hello,world\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and that's all.</p>\n\n<h2>Supported Markdown Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Lists</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>italics</em></li>\n<li><strong>bold</strong></li>\n<li>unordered lists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ordered</li>\n<li>List</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Blockquote</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Be the change you want to see in the world - Gandhi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Codeblocks and syntax highlighting</h3>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><code><span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;code blocks&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h3>Images</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"images/vangogh.jpg\" alt=\"Starry Skies\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Investigate changed files issue</li>\n<li>Display posts in reverse chronology</li>\n</ol>\n", "date_created": "16-09-2014 07:32:15", "tags": ["python", "angular", "github", " git"], "id": 0, "title": "Powered by gitnote"}], "Blog Title": "Plog", "pages": [], "Author": "Padmanabh"}
