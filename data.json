There are a couple of rough edges but it is mostly functional. At this point I cannot recommend anyone to use it, mainly because it is being built and tested on github pages, which forbids angular's routing-- which means no permalinking to individual articles. When I was writing it this wasn't a concern for me, but I will probably write its own cusotm backend one of these days.</p>\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n\n<p>Notes can be made inline or in markdown files, which are stored in a notes/ folder.

The above command creates a opens a new file in your default text-editor. Enter your note in markdown, save it, close and run </p>\n\n<pre><code>gitnote build\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If it is your first time it'll ask for some adidtional info, then your note is tracked and committed. Now you just push to whatever is your remote static file server and you're done.
