I have started using it for blogging and publishing inline notes. The aim is not to become a static generator, but rather a lightweight note management system. </p>\n\n<p>Python and angular.js are the two main technologies used. The static generation happens in python. Notes can be made inline or in markdown files, which are stored in a notes/ folder. Python then asks git for changes in this folder, parses the file, converts it file to html, puts them in a nice json file which is then used by angular on the frontend.
